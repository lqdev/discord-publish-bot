# Discord Publishing Bot Enhancement Project

**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Status**: Active  
**Phase**: Planning and Requirements Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The current Discord publishing bot publishes content directly to the main branch of the GitHub repository. Based on research of the target website structure (`example-dev/luisquintanilla.me`), there are three key improvements needed:

1. **Branch and PR Strategy**: Content should be published to feature branches with pull requests for review rather than direct main branch commits
2. **Frontmatter Schema Alignment**: Current test frontmatter doesn't match the actual website's YAML structure and field naming conventions
3. **Directory Structure Compliance**: Current directory structure doesn't align with the target website's established content organization patterns

### Strategic Approach
Following the autonomous partnership framework, this project will:
- Research and implement industry best practices for automated PR creation
- Analyze the target website's frontmatter patterns and implement schema compliance
- Align directory structure with the target site's content organization
- Maintain backward compatibility and provide smooth migration path

## 🔬 Research Findings

### Branch and PR Strategy Research
Based on comprehensive research of automated content publishing systems, the optimal approach includes:

- **Branch Naming Convention**: `content/discord-bot/{date}/{content-type}/{identifier}`
- **PR Creation**: Automated PR creation with comprehensive templates and validation
- **Security Controls**: Least privilege access, branch protection, and automated scanning
- **Review Workflow**: Intelligent content classification for appropriate review requirements

### Target Website Analysis
Analysis of `example-dev/luisquintanilla.me` reveals:

**Content Structure**:
```
_src/
├── posts/              # Long-form articles with post_type: "article"
├── notes/              # Short-form content with post_type: "note" 
├── responses/          # Social responses with response_type field
├── media/              # Photo/video albums (renamed from albums/)
└── resources/          # Knowledge base content
```

**Frontmatter Patterns**:
- **Posts**: `post_type: "article"`, `title`, `published_date`, `tags`
- **Notes**: `post_type: "note"`, `title`, `published_date`, `tags`
- **Responses**: `title`, `targeturl`, `response_type`, `dt_published`, `dt_updated`, `tags`
- **Media**: Custom media blocks with YAML frontmatter

## 🎯 Requirements Analysis

### 2. Frontmatter Schema Compliance

#### Current vs. Target Schema Mapping

**Notes** (current → target):
```yaml
# Current
type: note
date: "2025-08-08T10:30:00Z"
slug: "example-note"

# Target
post_type: "note"
title: "Generated Title"
published_date: "2025-08-08 10:30 -05:00"
tags: ["discord", "automated"]
```

**Responses** (current → target):
```yaml
# Current  
type: response
response_type: "bookmark"
date: "2025-08-08T10:30:00Z"

# Target
title: "Response Title"
targeturl: "https://example.com"
response_type: "bookmark"
dt_published: "2025-08-08 10:30"
dt_updated: "2025-08-08 10:30 -05:00"
tags: ["bookmarks", "automated"]
```

### 3. Directory Structure Alignment

#### Current vs. Target Directory Mapping
```
# Current Structure
posts/
├── notes/          → _src/notes/
├── responses/      → _src/responses/
├── bookmarks/      → _src/responses/ (with response_type: bookmark)
└── media/          → _src/media/

# Target Structure (luisquintanilla.me)
_src/
├── posts/          # Long-form articles
├── notes/          # Microblog notes  
├── responses/      # All response types (including bookmarks)
├── media/          # Photo/video albums
└── resources/      # Knowledge base content
```
