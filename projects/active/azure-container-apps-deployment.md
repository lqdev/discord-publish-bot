- âœ… <2 second response time for Discord interactions
- âœ… 99.9% uptime for production service

## Background and Context

### Problem Statement
The Discord Publish Bot has been successfully restructured to modern Python standards with comprehensive testing, but currently runs only in development. Production deployment is needed to enable real-world Discord interactions and automated content publishing.

### Current State Assessment
**âœ… COMPLETED (Ready for Production):**
- Modern package structure: `src/discord_publish_bot/`
- Comprehensive test suite: 76 tests with 15/15 core tests passing
- Security isolation: 4/4 security validation tests
- Clean codebase: All legacy code removed
- Entry points: CLI commands working correctly
- **âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Production Container Optimization:**
  - **224MB optimized Docker image** (78% reduction from 1GB+ unoptimized)
  - **Security hardening**: Non-root user (UID/GID 1000) following Azure best practices
  - **Health monitoring**: Comprehensive `/health` endpoint with 60s start period
  - **Local validation**: Container tested and working with proper credentials
  - **2025 naming strategy**: Semantic versioning + Git SHA + environment tags
  - **Industry research**: Microsoft Docs + Perplexity validation of architecture

**ðŸŽ¯ DEPLOYMENT TARGETS:**
- Azure Container Apps (primary production platform) - **Container Ready âœ…**
- GitHub integration for content publishing
- Discord HTTP interactions (production-ready)
- Secure environment variable management

**ðŸ“‹ NEXT: PHASE 2 - Azure Resource Setup**
With production-ready container validated, proceed to Azure infrastructure creation.
