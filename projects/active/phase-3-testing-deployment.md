- âœ… Both WebSocket and HTTP modes support slug fields
- âœ… GitHub integration handles slug-based filenames
- âœ… User workflow enhanced without breaking changes
- âœ… All security guidelines followed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Simplified Modal Design (Implemented)
```
MediaModal (4 consistent fields):
â”œâ”€â”€ Title (required)
â”œâ”€â”€ Content (required)
â”œâ”€â”€ Media URL (required)
â””â”€â”€ Custom Slug (optional)
```

### Enhanced Command Usage
```
/post media alt_text:"Image description" [attach file]
â†’ Opens simplified modal with consistent 4 fields
â†’ Alt text provided via command, slug optional in modal
```

### Expected File Generation
```
With slug: custom-slug-2025-09-07.md
Without slug: auto-generated-from-title-2025-09-07.md
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Complete)
