## Cost Optimization Achievement

### Azure Container Apps Benefits
- **Scale-to-Zero Billing**: HTTP-only architecture eliminates idle resource costs
- **Single Container**: Combined app reduces resource overhead and management complexity
- **No Persistent Connections**: Eliminates WebSocket connection maintenance costs
- **Standard HTTP**: Compatible with any HTTP-capable hosting platform

### Resource Efficiency Improvements
- **Before**: Multiple containers with persistent WebSocket connections
- **After**: Single HTTP-only container with scale-to-zero capability
- **Cost Impact**: Potentially 90%+ cost reduction for low-traffic usage patterns

## Technical Decisions & Architecture

### Key Architectural Patterns Implemented

#### 1. HTTP Interactions Pattern
```python
@app.post("/discord/interactions")
async def discord_interactions(request: Request, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Verify Discord signature with PyNaCl
    # Handle interaction immediately
    # Trigger background task for deferred processing
    # Return appropriate Discord response
```

#### 2. Deferred Response Pattern
```python
# Immediate Discord response
response = {"type": InteractionResponseType.DEFERRED_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE}

# Background task processing
background_tasks.add_task(process_post_creation, interaction, application_id)

# Followup message with results
await send_followup_message(application_id, token, result_message)
```

#### 3. Combined Application Architecture
```python
app = FastAPI(title="Discord Publishing Bot - Combined API")
app.mount("/api", publishing_app)  # Existing Publishing API
# Discord interactions endpoint integrated directly
```

### Technology Stack Updates
- **Added**: PyNaCl for Discord signature verification
- **Enhanced**: FastAPI with BackgroundTasks for async processing
- **Integrated**: Combined application architecture
- **Maintained**: All existing Publishing API functionality
