* Product Requirements Document (PRD)

** Overview
   The system will enable users to create and manage RSVP, media, and review posts on a static website through Discord interactions. Users will trigger workflows via slash commands, provide necessary inputs, and the system will generate corresponding Markdown files with front matter metadata. These files will be submitted as pull requests to the website's repository.

** Goals
   - Automate the creation of content posts via Discord.
   - Ensure posts are formatted correctly with front matter metadata.
   - Integrate with GitHub to submit posts as pull requests.
   - Provide a seamless user experience with minimal manual intervention.

** Features
   - `/rsvp`: Initiates an RSVP workflow, allowing users to specify event details and attendance status.
   - `/media`: Initiates a media post workflow, allowing users to upload media and provide captions.
   - `/review`: Initiates a review post workflow, allowing users to submit reviews with ratings and comments.
   - GitHub Integration: Automatically creates branches, commits, and pull requests for each post.
   - Markdown Generation: Posts are generated as Markdown files with YAML front matter.

** User Stories
   - As a user, I want to RSVP to events via Discord so that I can automatically generate a post on the website.
   - As a user, I want to upload media and provide captions via Discord so that I can share content on the website.
   - As a user, I want to submit reviews via Discord so that I can contribute feedback to the website.

* Technical Specification

** Components
   - Discord Bot: Handles user interactions and triggers workflows.
   - GitHub Integration: Manages repository operations (branches, commits, pull requests).
   - Markdown Generator: Converts user inputs into Markdown files with front matter.
   - File Storage: Temporarily stores media files before processing.

** Data Flow
   1. User triggers a slash command (`/rsvp`, `/media`, or `/review`).
   2. Bot prompts user for necessary inputs (e.g., event details, media uploads).
   3. Bot processes inputs and generates a Markdown file.
   4. Bot creates a new branch in the GitHub repository.
   5. Bot commits the Markdown file to the new branch.
   6. Bot opens a pull request for the new branch.

** GitHub API Usage
   - Create a new branch: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs`
   - Create a commit: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/commits`
   - Create a pull request: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls`

** Security Considerations
   - Use GitHub personal access tokens with appropriate scopes.
   - Securely store and manage tokens.
   - Validate user inputs to prevent malicious content.

** Hosting Environment
   - Platform: Azure Container Apps
   - Deployment: Azure CLI or GitHub Actions
   - Container Image: Python 3.9 with necessary dependencies

** Azure Container Apps Configuration
   - Resource Group: `my-container-apps`
   - Location: `centralus`
   - Environment: `my-container-apps-env`
   - Ingress: External
   - Target Port: `80`
   - CPU: `0.5`
   - Memory: `1Gi`

* Implementation Plan

** Phase 1: Discord Bot Development
   - Implement slash commands (`/rsvp`, `/media`, `/review`).
   - Handle user inputs and validate data.
   - Integrate with GitHub API to manage repository operations.
   - Implement Markdown generation with front matter metadata.

** Phase 2: GitHub Integration
   - Set up GitHub personal access tokens.
   - Implement functions to create branches, commits, and pull requests.
   - Handle errors and edge cases (e.g., conflicts, failed commits).

** Phase 3: Testing and Deployment
   - Test each workflow (`/rsvp`, `/media`, `/review`) with sample inputs.
   - Review generated Markdown files for correctness.
   - Test GitHub integration by reviewing and merging pull requests.
   - Deploy the bot to Azure Container Apps.

** Phase 4: Documentation and Training
   - Document the setup and usage of the system.
   - Provide training materials for users on how to interact with the bot.
   - Offer support channels for troubleshooting and feedback.

** Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance
   - Set up monitoring for the bot's performance and errors.
   - Regularly update dependencies and container images.
   - Address user feedback and make necessary improvements.

* Testing Strategy

** Unit Tests
   - Test Markdown generation functions with various inputs.
   - Mock GitHub API calls to test repository operations.

** Integration Tests
   - Test end-to-end workflows (`/rsvp`, `/media`, `/review`) with sample inputs.
   - Verify that pull requests are created and can be merged.

** User Acceptance Testing
   - Conduct testing with actual users to ensure the system meets their needs.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

* Future Enhancements

** Phase 6: Advanced Features
   - Implement media file processing (e.g., resizing, format conversion).
   - Add support for additional post types (e.g., blog posts, announcements).
   - Implement scheduling for posts (e.g., publish at a later time).

** Phase 7: User Interface Improvements
