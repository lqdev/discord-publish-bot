# ADR-009: Azure Container Apps Deployment Status and Prerequisites

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Decision Makers:** AI Development Partner  
**Technical Story:** Phase 2 Azure deployment initiation with infrastructure setup

## Context

Following the completion of Phase 1 (container optimization and test stabilization), we initiated Phase 2 of the Azure Container Apps deployment as outlined in `projects/active/azure-container-apps-deployment.md`. During the Azure CLI setup process, we encountered authentication and subscription access requirements that need to be addressed before proceeding with resource creation.

### Current Achievement Status
- ‚úÖ **Azure CLI Installation**: Successfully installed Azure CLI 2.76.0 via WinGet
- ‚úÖ **Tool Verification**: Azure CLI working correctly with `az --version`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication**: MFA required, no active subscriptions found for developer@example.com
- üö´ **Resource Creation**: Blocked pending subscription access resolution

### Technical Environment Validated
- **Windows Environment**: PowerShell with Azure CLI 2.76.0 functional
- **Container Ready**: 224MB production-optimized container available for deployment
- **Test Infrastructure**: 46/46 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Documentation**: Complete deployment plan and architecture decisions ready

## Decision

Implement a **staged approach to Azure subscription requirements** before proceeding with Container Apps resource creation.

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Azure Subscription Verification**: Determine appropriate subscription access approach
2. **Resource Provider Registration**: Register Microsoft.App and Microsoft.OperationalInsights providers
3. **Permission Validation**: Ensure Contributor/Owner access on target subscription
4. **Container Apps Extension**: Install Azure CLI extension for Container Apps

### Deployment Prerequisites (Research-Validated)
Based on Microsoft documentation research, Azure Container Apps deployment requires:

#### Mandatory Requirements
- **Azure Account**: Active subscription with billing enabled
- **Permissions**: Contributor or Owner role on the subscription
- **Resource Providers**: Microsoft.App and Microsoft.OperationalInsights registered
- **Azure CLI**: Version 2.0.0 or later (‚úÖ 2.76.0 installed)

#### Optional but Recommended
- **Azure Container Registry**: For private container image hosting
- **GitHub Integration**: For CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Application Insights**: For monitoring and observability

### Azure Free Account Option
Microsoft provides Azure free accounts with:
- **$200 Credit**: First 30 days
- **Free Services**: 12 months of popular services
- **Always Free**: Limited quantities of select services
- **Container Apps**: Included in free tier with consumption-based pricing

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Azure Free Account Creation
**Pros:**
- Immediate access to Azure services
- No upfront cost with $200 credit
- Full Container Apps support
- Complete control over subscription

**Cons:**
- Requires personal credit card for verification
- Resource limits on free tier
- Time investment for account setup

### Option 2: Existing Subscription Access Verification
**Pros:**
- May already have access through organization/work
- No additional account setup required
- Potentially higher resource limits

**Cons:**
- Requires investigation of current subscription status
- May need administrator assistance
- Potential permission/access restrictions

### Option 3: Alternative Container Deployment Platform
**Pros:**
- Could proceed immediately with different platform
- No Azure-specific requirements

**Cons:**
- Abandons research-validated Azure Container Apps approach
- Loses scale-to-zero cost optimization benefits
- Requires rework of deployment plan and documentation

## Decision Rationale

**Chosen Approach: Option 1 - Azure Free Account Creation (Recommended)**

This decision aligns with the autonomous partnership framework:
- **Research-Enhanced**: Microsoft documentation confirms free account suitability for Container Apps
- **Production Ready**: Free tier supports production workloads with scale-to-zero billing
- **Cost Optimized**: $200 credit provides significant deployment and testing capability
- **Future Scalability**: Easy upgrade path to paid subscription as needed

### Technical Justification
1. **Container Apps Compatibility**: Free tier fully supports our 224MB production container
2. **Scale-to-Zero Billing**: Aligns perfectly with Discord bot usage patterns (95%+ idle time)
3. **Resource Sufficiency**: Free tier limits exceed our single-user Discord bot requirements
4. **Development Lifecycle**: Supports complete CI/CD pipeline and monitoring setup

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2A: Azure Subscription Setup (30 minutes)
1. **Create Azure Free Account**: Navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/free/
2. **Complete Verification**: Provide required information and payment method
3. **Validate Access**: Test `az login` and subscription listing
4. **Register Providers**: Enable Container Apps and Log Analytics providers

### Phase 2B: Azure Resource Creation (2-3 hours)
1. **Resource Group**: `<resource-group-name>`
2. **Container Apps Environment**: `<container-app-environment>`
3. **Container App**: `<container-app-name>` with scale-to-zero configuration
4. **Monitoring**: Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights

### Phase 2C: Application Deployment (1-2 hours)
1. **Container Registry**: Azure Container Registry for production images
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions deployment workflow
3. **Environment Variables**: Secure secrets management
4. **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive application monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Unblocked Deployment**: Clear path forward for Azure Container Apps deployment
- **Research-Validated Approach**: Following Microsoft best practices and documentation
- **Cost Optimization**: Free tier + scale-to-zero provides cost-effective solution
- **Production Readiness**: Full feature parity with paid subscriptions for our use case

### Potential Challenges
- **Account Setup Time**: 15-30 minutes for Azure free account creation
- **Learning Curve**: Azure-specific terminology and concepts
- **Resource Monitoring**: Need to track usage against free tier limits

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment runbook with step-by-step guidance
- **Monitoring**: Proactive resource usage tracking and alerts
- **Backup Plans**: Alternative deployment platforms researched and documented
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete architectural decisions and learnings captured

## Monitoring and Review

### Success Metrics
- **Account Creation**: Azure subscription active and accessible via CLI
- **Resource Deployment**: Container Apps environment operational
- **Application Health**: Discord bot responding to interactions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Billing within expected ranges (near-zero for idle periods)

### Review Schedule
- **Phase 2A Review**: After subscription setup completion
- **Phase 2B Review**: After initial resource deployment
- **Monthly Review**: Resource usage and cost optimization assessment
- **Quarterly Review**: Architecture and scaling decision validation
