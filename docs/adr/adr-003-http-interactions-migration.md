# ADR-003: Discord HTTP Interactions Migration for Azure Container Apps

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Technical Story:** Enable Discord bot deployment on Azure Container Apps with scale-to-zero cost optimization

## Context

### Original Challenge
The user wanted to deploy the Discord publishing bot to Azure Container Apps for cost optimization, specifically to take advantage of scale-to-zero billing. However, the original WebSocket-based Discord bot architecture (discord.py with Gateway connection) was incompatible with serverless scale-to-zero deployment due to persistent connection requirements.

### Business Requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize hosting costs using Azure Container Apps scale-to-zero billing
- **Functionality Preservation**: Maintain all existing Discord bot functionality
- **Production Quality**: Ensure robust, production-ready implementation
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Single application for simplified container deployment

### Technical Constraints
- Azure Container Apps scale-to-zero requires HTTP-only applications
- Discord WebSocket Gateway connections prevent container scaling to zero
- Need to maintain Discord interactions, modal forms, and publishing workflow
- Must preserve all existing post types and GitHub integration

## Decision

### Architectural Migration: WebSocket → HTTP Interactions

**Decision**: Migrate from discord.py WebSocket Gateway to Discord HTTP Interactions API for complete serverless compatibility.

#### Core Implementation Strategy
1. **Replace WebSocket bot** with HTTP interactions webhook endpoint
2. **Implement PyNaCl signature verification** for Discord security
3. **Create combined FastAPI application** integrating Discord + Publishing APIs
4. **Maintain all existing functionality** through HTTP-based interaction handling
5. **Enable background processing** for deferred Discord responses

## Implementation Details

### 1. Discord HTTP Interactions Architecture

#### New Component Structure
```
src/discord_interactions/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization
├── config.py           # Environment-based configuration
├── bot.py              # HTTP interactions handler
└── api_client.py       # Publishing API integration
```

#### Key Technical Components
- **DiscordConfig**: Environment variable management with validation
- **DiscordInteractionsBot**: HTTP webhook request handling with PyNaCl verification
- **InteractionsAPIClient**: Background task communication with Publishing API
- **Combined App**: Single FastAPI application with mounted endpoints

### 2. Security Implementation

#### Discord Request Verification
```python
# PyNaCl-based Ed25519 signature verification
def verify_signature(self, signature: str, timestamp: str, body: bytes) -> bool:
    try:
        self.verify_key.verify(
            f"{timestamp}{body.decode('utf-8')}".encode(),
            bytes.fromhex(signature)
        )
        return True
    except BadSignatureError:
        return False
```

#### Authorization System
- User-based access control with authorized Discord user ID validation
- API key authentication for Publishing API integration
- Request signature verification preventing unauthorized webhook calls

### 3. Interaction Handling System

#### Supported Interaction Types
- **PING**: Discord verification handshake (responds with PONG)
- **APPLICATION_COMMAND**: Slash commands (`/ping`, `/post`)
- **MODAL_SUBMIT**: Form submission processing for post creation

#### Modal-Based Post Creation
- Type-specific forms for note, response, bookmark, media posts
- Discord native UI components with validation
- Deferred responses with background task processing

### 4. Combined Application Architecture

#### Single FastAPI Application
```python
app = FastAPI(title="Discord Publishing Bot - Combined API")

# Mount existing Publishing API
app.mount("/api", publishing_app)

# Discord interactions endpoint
@app.post("/discord/interactions")
async def discord_interactions(request: Request, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Handle Discord webhooks with signature verification
    # Process interactions and trigger background tasks
```

#### Endpoint Organization
- `/discord/interactions`: Discord webhook endpoint with signature verification
- `/api/*`: Complete Publishing API mounted for GitHub operations
- `/health`: Azure Container Apps health check endpoint
- `/`: Service status and endpoint discovery

### 5. Background Task Processing

#### Deferred Response Pattern
1. **Immediate Response**: Discord interactions get immediate DEFERRED response
2. **Background Processing**: FastAPI BackgroundTasks handle post creation
3. **Followup Messages**: Results sent via Discord webhook followup messages
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting through Discord

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep WebSocket with Always-On Deployment
**Rejected** because it eliminates cost optimization benefits of scale-to-zero billing.

### Alternative 2: Hybrid Architecture with Message Queue
**Rejected** due to added complexity and infrastructure requirements that contradict serverless goals.

### Alternative 3: Separate Discord and API Containers
**Rejected** because multiple containers increase complexity and resource usage.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

#### ✅ Cost Optimization Achieved
- **Scale-to-Zero Compatible**: HTTP-only architecture enables Azure Container Apps scale-to-zero
- **Resource Efficiency**: Single combined application reduces container overhead
- **No Persistent Connections**: Eliminates WebSocket connection maintenance costs

#### ✅ Production Quality Maintained
- **Complete E2E Validation**: Real GitHub PRs created during testing (#104, #105, #106)
- **All Functionality Preserved**: Every Discord command and post type working
- **Security Enhanced**: PyNaCl signature verification adds robust security layer
- **Error Handling Improved**: Structured error responses through Discord native UI

#### ✅ Development Experience Enhanced
- **Modern Architecture**: FastAPI-based with OpenAPI documentation
- **Testing Excellence**: Three-tier test suite (basic, config-independent, E2E)
- **Development Flexibility**: Can run locally or in cloud with same codebase
- **Debugging Capability**: Comprehensive logging and structured error responses

#### ✅ Deployment Simplification
- **Single Application**: One container instead of multiple microservices
- **Standard HTTP**: Works with any HTTP-capable hosting platform
- **Health Checks**: Built-in Azure Container Apps health monitoring
- **Environment Configuration**: Standard environment variable management

### Technical Trade-offs

#### HTTP vs WebSocket Considerations
- **Latency**: HTTP interactions have slightly higher latency than WebSocket (acceptable for Discord bots)
- **Connection Model**: Request/response model instead of persistent connection (better for serverless)
- **Discord Rate Limits**: Same rate limits apply regardless of connection method
- **Functionality**: HTTP interactions support all Discord features used by the bot

#### Architectural Complexity
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single application reduces operational complexity
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation between Discord and Publishing logic
- **Testing Strategy**: More complex test scenarios but better coverage
- **Monitoring**: Centralized logging and health checking

        "status": "healthy",
        "discord_configured": discord_bot is not None,
        "api_configured": True
    }
```

### Operational Considerations
- **Log Aggregation**: Structured logging for Discord interactions and Publishing API
- **Error Tracking**: Discord native error reporting plus application logging
