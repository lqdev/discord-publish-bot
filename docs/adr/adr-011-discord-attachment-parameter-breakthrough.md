# ADR-011: Discord Attachment Parameter Structure Breakthrough

## Status
âœ… **Accepted** - 2025-08-11

## Context

### Problem Statement
The Discord bot's attachment functionality was failing in production with "Attachment received: None" errors, preventing the generation of media blocks for uploaded attachments. Users could not successfully use the `/post media [attachment]` command despite the infrastructure being in place.

### Investigation Context
- **Production Environment**: Azure Container Apps with HTTP interactions webhook
- **User Workflow**: `/post media [attachment]` command with file upload
- **Expected Behavior**: Attachment URL should pre-fill in modal and generate `:::media` blocks
- **Actual Behavior**: "Attachment received: None" logged, no media block generation
- **Impact**: Complete failure of Discord attachment functionality

### Technical Investigation
Systematic debugging revealed the Discord interaction parameter structure was misunderstood:

```python
# Previous Incorrect Implementation
attachment = option.get("attachment")  # Always returned None

# Discord Actual Structure (Discovered)
attachment_id = option["value"]  # Discord sends attachment ID here
attachment_data = interaction["data"]["resolved"]["attachments"][attachment_id]
```

## Decision

### Architectural Decision: Correct Discord Attachment Parameter Extraction

**Resolution**: Update attachment parameter extraction logic to correctly handle Discord's two-step attachment resolution process.

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Extract Attachment ID**: Get attachment ID from `option["value"]` parameter
2. **Resolve Attachment Data**: Look up actual attachment data from `interaction["data"]["resolved"]["attachments"][attachment_id]`
3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Add comprehensive attachment parameter logging
4. **Validation Integration**: Proper error handling for missing or invalid attachments

#### Technical Implementation
```python
def _extract_attachment_from_options(self, options: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Extract attachment data from Discord interaction options."""
    for option in options:
        if option["name"] == "attachment":
            attachment_id = option["value"]  # Discord sends ID in value field
            logger.info(f"Found attachment ID: {attachment_id}")
            
            # Resolve actual attachment data from resolved.attachments
            resolved = self.interaction_data.get("resolved", {})
            attachments = resolved.get("attachments", {})
            
            if attachment_id in attachments:
                attachment_data = attachments[attachment_id]
                logger.info(f"Resolved attachment: {attachment_data['filename']}")
                return attachment_data
                
    return None
```

### Potential Challenges (Mitigated)
ðŸŸ¡ **Discord API Changes**: Discord could modify attachment parameter structure  
- **Mitigation**: Enhanced logging provides early detection of API changes
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed attachment parameter logging

ðŸŸ¡ **Attachment Type Variations**: Different attachment types may have varying parameter structures  
- **Mitigation**: Generic attachment handling with type-agnostic validation
- **Extensibility**: Framework supports future attachment type expansion

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- **src/discord_publish_bot/discord/interactions.py**: Updated `_extract_attachment_from_options()` method
- **src/discord_publish_bot/discord/interactions.py**: Enhanced debug logging throughout attachment processing
- **src/discord_publish_bot/discord/interactions.py**: Improved error handling for attachment resolution

### Validation Process
1. **Code Implementation**: Updated attachment parameter extraction logic
2. **Local Testing**: Verified attachment ID extraction and data resolution
3. **Production Deployment**: Deployed fix to Azure Container Apps revision 0000029  
4. **User Validation**: Direct user testing confirmed functionality: **"It worked!!!!"**
5. **Documentation**: Captured breakthrough understanding for future development

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: Complete Discord attachment upload to GitHub PR workflow
- **User Experience**: Seamless attachment data pre-filling in modal
- **Media Generation**: Proper `:::media` blocks with url, alt, mediaType, aspectRatio, caption
- **Performance**: Attachment processing within 2-second response requirement
- **Production**: Fully operational in Azure Container Apps production environment

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Mock Attachment Data
**Approach**: Generate fake attachment data for testing purposes  
**Rejected**: Would not solve actual production functionality gap  
**Reason**: Need real attachment functionality for production use

### Alternative 2: Different Discord API Method
**Approach**: Use Discord bot API instead of HTTP interactions  
**Rejected**: Would require architectural change from serverless to persistent connection  
**Reason**: HTTP interactions architecture required for Azure Container Apps scale-to-zero

### Alternative 3: External File Upload Service
**Approach**: Implement separate file upload service bypassing Discord attachments  
**Rejected**: Would complicate user experience and Discord integration  
**Reason**: Users expect native Discord attachment functionality
