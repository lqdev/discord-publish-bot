## Month 1: Autonomous Contribution

### 30-Day Mastery Assessment

#### Technical Proficiency Checkpoints
- [ ] **Independent Development**: Can implement features using established patterns
- [ ] **Testing Mastery**: Writes comprehensive tests following project standards
- [ ] **Documentation**: Creates and updates documentation using template framework
- [ ] **Security Awareness**: Follows security guidelines automatically
- [ ] **Production Understanding**: Understands deployment and monitoring systems

#### Contribution Readiness
- [ ] **Research-First Approach**: Validates architectural decisions before implementation

- [ ] **Autonomous Decision Making**: Uses Green/Yellow/Red framework effectively
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Code passes all tests and follows established patterns
- [ ] **Knowledge Sharing**: Documents discoveries and improvements in appropriate locations

### Advanced Development Patterns

#### Feature Flag Migration Pattern (Proven 8x Success)
```python
# Always implement new alongside old systems
if feature_flags.use_new_attachment_processor:
    result = new_attachment_processor.process(attachment)
else:
    result = legacy_attachment_processor.process(attachment)

# Validate identical output before cutover
# Remove legacy code immediately after successful deployment
```

#### Research-Enhanced Decision Making
```python
# Before implementing new architecture:
# 1. Research similar patterns in documentation
# 2. Validate approaches with best practices
# 3. Use reasoning tools for trade-off analysis  
# 4. Research BEFORE coding, not during debugging
```

#### Documentation Integration (Not One-Off Files)
```markdown
# ✅ Enhance existing documentation
- Update archived project files with discoveries
- Add insights to relevant ADRs and team docs  
- Integrate next steps into backlog.md
- Use changelog.md for release-worthy updates

# ❌ Never create standalone files
- No PROJECT-COMPLETION-REPORT.md files
- No SESSION-SUMMARY.md or temporary files
- No root-level status or planning documents
```
