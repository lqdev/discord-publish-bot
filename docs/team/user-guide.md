## üîß Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

#### "Bot doesn't respond to commands"
**Causes**:
- Bot not properly invited to server
- Missing permissions for slash commands
- Your Discord User ID not authorized

**Solutions**:
1. Check bot is online (should show green status)
2. Verify bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission
3. Contact administrator to confirm your user authorization
4. Try command in different channel

#### "Modal doesn't appear"
**Causes**:
- Network connectivity issues
- Discord client needs refresh
- Command syntax error

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh Discord (Ctrl+R)
2. Retry command exactly: `/post note`
3. Check Discord developer console for errors
4. Try different device/browser

#### "GitHub PR not created"
**Causes**:
- GitHub API rate limiting
- Repository permissions issue
- Network connectivity to GitHub

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes and check GitHub repository
2. Verify repository exists and is accessible
3. Contact administrator about GitHub configuration
4. Check [service status page] if available

#### "Malformed frontmatter"
**Causes**:
- Special characters in title or tags
- Very long content causing processing issues
- Network timeout during processing

**Solutions**:
1. Avoid special characters in titles: `#`, `"`, `'`
2. Keep titles under 100 characters
3. Break very long content into smaller posts
4. Retry with simpler content to test

### Content Guidelines

#### Recommended Content Length
- **Notes**: 50-2000 characters (optimal: 200-800)
- **Responses**: 100-1500 characters (be thoughtful, not just "I agree")
- **Bookmark notes**: 50-500 characters (explain why it's valuable)
- **Media captions**: 20-300 characters (describe what's shown)

#### Content Quality Tips
- **Be authentic**: Write in your own voice
- **Add value**: Share insights, not just information
- **Use context**: Explain why something matters
- **Link related ideas**: Reference previous posts when relevant
- **Edit ruthlessly**: Better to post less but higher quality

#### What Works Well
- **Personal observations** about technology, culture, life
- **Thoughtful responses** to articles, videos, social media
- **Curated bookmarks** with explanation of value
- **Behind-the-scenes content** from projects or work
- **Progress updates** on learning or building

#### What to Avoid
- **Spam or promotional content** without value
- **Very short posts** that don't add meaningful content
- **Duplicate content** already posted elsewhere
- **Extremely long posts** better suited for full blog articles
- **Sensitive information** that shouldn't be public
