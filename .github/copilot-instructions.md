### Essential Workflow Pattern
1. **Initiate**: Research & plan using templates → Create documentation in appropriate directories → Begin structured implementation
2. **Develop**: Incremental changes → Continuous testing → Real-time documentation updates
3. **Complete**: Comprehensive validation → Archive project → Update knowledge base and changelog

### Critical Project Rules
- **Template-First Approach**: Use provided templates for all new documentation
- **Directory Discipline**: Place documentation in correct directories based on purpose
- **Single Active Focus**: Only current work in `projects/active/`
- **Structured Logging**: Phase logs for complex work, immediate cleanup after completion
- **Continuous Testing**: Build and validate after each significant change
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document all decisions using appropriate templates

### Project State Management
| State | Symbol | Location | Action |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Backlog** | `[ ]` | `backlog.md` | Strategic planning using backlog template |
| **Planned** | `📋` | `projects/planned/[name].md` | PRD created, ready for development |
| **Active** | `[>]` | `projects/active/[name].md` | Current work with implementation plan |
| **Complete** | ✅ | `projects/archive/[name].md` | Archived with lessons learned |

### Documentation Creation Workflow

#### Starting New Documentation
1. **Identify Purpose**: Determine which directory and template to use
2. **Copy Template**: Use appropriate template from `templates/` directory
3. **Customize Content**: Fill in project-specific information
4. **Link Appropriately**: Ensure proper cross-references between documents
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep documentation current with implementation

#### Documentation Decision Matrix
| Document Type | Template | Directory | When to Create |
|---------------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Architecture Decision | `adr-template.md` | `docs/adr/` | Significant architectural changes |
| Product Requirement | `prd-template.md` | `projects/` | New features or major changes |
| Technical Specification | `spec-template.md` | `specs/technical/` | Implementation planning |
| API Documentation | `api-docs-template.md` | `specs/api/` | API creation or updates |
| Process Documentation | `runbook-template.md` | `docs/team/` | Operational procedures |
| Team Onboarding | `onboarding-template.md` | `docs/team/` | New team member integration |
