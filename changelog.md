## [2.3.1] - 2025-09-07 - 🔧 CRITICAL SLUG FUNCTIONALITY FIX ✅ DEPLOYED

### 🔴 Critical Bug Fix: Custom Slug Parameter Missing in Publishing Service
Fixed critical issue where custom slug field was captured in modals but not passed to filename generation, causing all posts to use title-based filenames regardless of custom slug input.

#### 🚨 Issue Details  
- **Root Cause**: Publishing service not passing `slug` parameter to `generate_filename()` function
- **Impact**: Custom slug field in all modals was non-functional - slug captured but ignored during file creation
- **Discovery**: PR #177 analysis revealed title-based filename despite populated slug field
- **Affected Components**: All post types (note, response, bookmark, media)

#### ✅ Resolution Implemented
- **File Modified**: `src/discord_publish_bot/publishing/service.py` line 133  
- **Change**: Updated `generate_filename(post_data.post_type, post_data.title)` → `generate_filename(post_data.post_type, post_data.title, post_data.slug)`
- **Validation**: All 18 slug generation tests passing, 34 total enhancement tests confirmed working
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintained - slug parameter is optional with proper fallback

#### 🎯 User Impact
- **Before Fix**: Custom slug field appeared in modals but was ignored - all files used auto-generated names from titles
- **After Fix**: Custom slug field now properly controls filename generation as designed
- **Enhanced UX**: Users can now control URL structure and SEO optimization through custom slug input
- **Fallback Preserved**: Auto-generation from title still works when slug field is empty

#### 🔍 Technical Details
- **Function Signature**: `generate_filename(post_type, title, slug=None)` - existing API supports the change
- **Priority Logic**: Slug → Title fallback already implemented and tested
- **Modal Integration**: All modal types properly capture and pass slug values
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite validates all slug functionality paths

#### 🚀 Production Deployment Complete (2025-09-07)
- **Azure Container Apps**: Successfully deployed new revision with slug fix
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets properly restored with secret references
- **Health Verification**: ✅ All endpoints responding - Discord and GitHub integrations operational
- **User Validation**: Slug functionality confirmed working in production environment
- **Zero Downtime**: Container Apps revision model enabled seamless deployment

## [2.2.3] - 2025-08-21 - 🕐 TIMEZONE CONSISTENCY FIX

### 🔧 Frontmatter Timezone Consistency
Fixed timezone inconsistency in response/bookmark frontmatter date fields to ensure all content types use the same `-05:00` Eastern timezone format.

#### ✅ Fixed
- **Timezone Consistency**: Response `dt_published` field now consistently includes `-05:00` timezone offset
- **Documentation Update**: Updated docstring to reflect "consistently" using `-05:00` timezone
- **Quality Assurance**: All content types now use identical timezone format in frontmatter

#### 🎯 Technical Details
**Issue**: Response/bookmark posts had inconsistent timezone usage:
- `dt_published`: Missing timezone offset (`"2025-08-21 14:30"`)
- `dt_updated`: Had timezone offset (`"2025-08-21 14:30 -05:00"`)

**Resolution**: Both fields now consistently use the `-05:00` Eastern timezone format as required by the site schema.

**Impact**: Ensures uniform date formatting across all content types (Notes, Responses, Bookmarks, Media).

#### 🚀 Production Deployment
- **Deployment Time**: 2025-08-21 23:17 UTC
- **Revision**: New revision successfully deployed  
- **Health Status**: ✅ All services operational
- **Environment Config**: ✅ Secret references properly configured

## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-10 - 🔧 CRITICAL MODAL ROUTING FIX

### 🚨 Fixed: Discord Modal Type Mismatch Bug
**Issue**: Response, bookmark, and media post commands were incorrectly showing the note modal in production
**Root Cause**: Parameter name mismatch between WebSocket bot (`post_type`) and HTTP interactions handler (`type`)
**Impact**: Users could not access proper modals for non-note post types in production deployment
